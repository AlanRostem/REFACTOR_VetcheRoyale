Initialize properties ONLY in constructor

Remove ES6 getters and setters

Prevent all forms of object creation (besides numbers) every tick

CONSIDERATION: Replace `instance of` operator with a new system by creating
a custom string based inheritance chain

Use flyweight pattern for entities (such as projectile or weapons) to
statically assign configurations (weapon stats, projectile speeds)
